# Dev Side for Derek Dunwiddie's Portfolio Project

## About The Project

This is the repository for my portfolio project before it goes live [here](https://dunwiddie.netlify.com/). It's not elegant, but it's a start.

My project is a simple scheduling site that helps visualize gaps of open time and fill those spaces dynamically with activities that help you achieve your goals and stay sane.

## About Me

I am a student in Savvy Coder's Fall Cohort. This is my portfolio project.
